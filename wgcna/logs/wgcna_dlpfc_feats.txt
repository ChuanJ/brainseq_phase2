*  Package WGCNA 1.61 loaded.
*
*    Important note: It appears that your system supports multi-threading,
*    but it is not enabled within WGCNA in R. 
*    To allow multi-threading within WGCNA with all available cores, use 
*
*          allowWGCNAThreads()
*
*    within R. Use disableWGCNAThreads() to disable threading if necessary.
*    Alternatively, set the following environment variable on your system:
*
*          ALLOW_WGCNA_THREADS=<number_of_processors>
*
*    for example 
*
*          ALLOW_WGCNA_THREADS=24
*
*    To set the environment variable in linux bash shell, type 
*
*           export ALLOW_WGCNA_THREADS=24
*
*     before running R. Other operating systems or shells will
*     have a similar command to achieve the same aim.

   Flagging genes and samples with too many missing values...
    ..step 1
  ..Excluding 332 genes from the calculation due to too many missing samples or zero variance.
    ..step 2
 ....pre-clustering genes to determine blocks..
   Projective K-means:
   ..k-means clustering..
   ..merging smaller clusters...
